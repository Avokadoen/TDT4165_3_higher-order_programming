    % Task 1b) Why are procedural abstractions useful?  Give at least two reasons
    {System.showInfo 'See comments for answer of Task 1b'}
    % Procedural abstraction is useful for countless reasons. One of the main reasons is to avoid
    % duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad as it can lead to unnecessary bugs as you copy your code around in your codebase. 
    % It becomes harder to maintain as changes to the code blocks are required multiple places in your codebase instead of in the procedure block.
    % Procedural abstraction is also useful for encapsulation, and opens for the possibility to use the countless patterns
    % that utilize procedures. Recursion, Currying (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying), etc â€¦
    % Function pointers are also very useful. Example of a good use-case is input bindings. 
    % The program can have a set of bindable procedures, and then the user can configure which keys
    % that points to which procedure.   


    % Task 1c) What is the difference between a procedure and a function?
    {System.showInfo 'See comments for answer of Task 1c'}
    % Procedures is a companion feature with functions in OZ. It *seems* one should use functions 
    % when you are making something that should take in data, and return a produced output.
    % Functions are in other words reserved for pure function oriented code. 
    % Procedures in turn seem to fit when you want side effects or no internal effect.
    % Unlike OZ, C only has function. A C function signature looks like:
    % int max(int num1, int num2) { /* code */ }
    % But since you have type annotations, you can also express OZ procedures:
    % void max(int num1, int num2, int* out) { /* code */ }

    % So OZ's procedures are form of traditional functions where you have no explicit 
    % return value. But OZ's procedures brings some features to the table to justify 
    % separating between function and procedures. 
    %   - You can express which value you would like to extract as a return value like I did in task 1 a.
    %   - Procedures can be used as function pointers and/or lambdas/closures
    %     Example from documentation: 
    %     local 
    %         Max = proc {$ X Y Z}
    %                   if X >= Y then Z = X
    %                   else Z = Y end 
    %               end 
    %         X = 5
    %         Y = 10
    %         Z
    %     in 
    %       {Max X Y Z} {Browse Z}
    %     end 
    % Example of no internal side effect could be a procedure that creates a file 
    % and does not report the outcome of the operation

    % One limitation of this abstraction is performance in a lot of use cases.
    % i.e If you want to repeatedly loop from 1 to 1000 you will create a lot
    % of extra garbage as we construct a tuple and a closjure for each iteration
    % if the language don't utilize certain optimization, it will also do
    % a lot of unnecessary stack allocation as this is something that happens each
    % time a program enters a function.

    % Another limitation of *this specific* implementation is that iterating large amounts
    % is very verbose.  

    {System.showInfo '\nTask 6a, please see comments in source code'}

    % Notice the pyramid shape as we grow our expression, this
    % can be very bad if you want to run your code at scale.
    % to fix this we can defined sum as i have with MyList.SumTR

    % fun {SumTR L}
    %     local 
    %         fun {Go Sum L}
    %             case L of Head|Tail then

    {System.showInfo '\nTask 6c, please see comments in source code'}
    % Yes, and no. You can benefit without further optimizations done by the compiler
    % as the memory useage can be reduces. You will still get problems with 
    % blowing your stack among other things if the compiler is not capable of utilizing tail recursion
    % optimizations. 

    % So in other words: the major gains from tail recursion comes from the compilers 
    % optimizing the output code, but not all gains comes from the just compiler.
